									<h2><a href=>◎What is the Brink?◎</a></h2>
									<p>Simply put, the Brink is the name for the setting of this story. It is a collection of 7 Factions that each inhabit a system of the known universe. Beyond the Brink is uncharted space, disconnected from the web which controls the flow of all goods and information. Naturally, the web is under the control of CHIMERA, the universe's biggest super-conglomerate.

									<h2><a href=>◎What is CHIMERA?◎</a></h2>
									<p>CHIMERA is an interplanetary super conglomerate obsessed with the acquisition and commercialization of mostly uninhabited planets. After the invention of the Cereb Jump modification, and the establishment of the Universal Code, the Chimera Corp grew exponentially, becoming the largest company in the entire universe. It employs trillions of individuals every cycle to conquer, terra-form, claim, or establish treaties on foreign and unmarked planets throughout various different galaxies within the Brink. In short, they buy and sell worlds with little concern as to what their inhabitants think. Not to mention they act as liaisons for universal commerce. Sticking their thumbs deep into the many different businesses that funnel credits across each and every planet within the Brink. Technology, medical supplies, political establishment, arms dealing, magik flux, you name it. If there’s money to be made, CHIMERA is taking a cut of it. Naturally a business of this scale couldn't have just a single figurehead. So once the Cereb Jump opened bridges all across the galaxy, it wasn't long before the original council that oversaw CHIMERA was up for re-election. However, there was a sudden and unfortunate "departure" of over 220 candidates that had been brought in to apply for the council positions. In the end there was only one applicant left to fill all three 3 seats. So, naturally, he cloned himself. Since then CHIMERA has been overseen by the council of Mr. Mables.

									<h2><a href=>◎What is the Cereb Jump?◎</a></h2>
									<p>A “Cereb Jump” refers to the revolutionary Stellar Flight Modification invented nearly a century ago that began rapidly expanding the borders of the Brink. It allows pilots to jump through rifts in space that they open with their own minds. The act is incredibly tasking however, so it is not unusual to have the job of Jumper delegated to a singular member of a ship’s crew. By using psychic markers implanted within the various planets of the Brink, Jumpers can open rifts that skip through millions of lightyears of travel. This is one of, if not the, most important technological advancement of the past million years.

									<h2><a href=>◎What is the Eden Complex◎</a></h2>
									<p>The Eden Complex is the name of the first and only Universal Code. The laws that dictate all life within the Brink are contained within it. Most importantly, the Eden Complex established the borders between the 7 Factions of the Brink, and named each Faction’s leader. The Universal Code also details how CHIMERA has complete control over extra-universal travel. Flying into uncharted space is strictly prohibited unless you expressly work for the corporation.  These rules were founded in a legendary summit on the CHIMERA home planet of Limen. There, several leaders from all across the known universe converged. Tyrants, Kings, Councils, Elected officials, Sultans, Chiefs, Elders, Dictators, Clergymen, Chairmen, Governors, Lords, Warlords, Sheriffs, Monarchs, V.I.P.s, Emperors, Presidents, Shoguns, Usurpers, Sovereigns, and virtually any other being that held a significant position of power all gathered upon Limen under the assumption that they were to organize a set of laws that would strengthen relations within the vastness of the cosmos. It wasn't long before the civil discussions devolved into a screaming fit, and once that began, CHIMERA revealed its true intentions. On that day the weak were purged from the universe. Millions of leaders were killed in a violent bloodbath. CHIMERA had rigged the summit, leaving only 7 of the original 7,875,662 attendees alive. These 7 leaders were each given a faction of the mapped universe that they would control, as long as they endorsed CHIMERA and all of its adjuncts. Not surprisingly, the 7 agreed and signed what is now known as the Universal Code. Allowing free travel across all 7 Factions of the known universe, but forbidding unregistered exploration. CHIMERA would oversee all expeditions into the unknown. Each faction had its own set of laws in place, as neighboring city-states might have. Some clashed while others gelled. In the end, it was all CHIMERA's anyway.

									<h2><a href=>◎What are the Seven Factions?◎</a></h2>
									<p>The Brink is split up into 7 Factions. Each faction roughly inhabits one system of the known universe with some minor exceptions here and there. Each faction has its own unique rules and directives that govern and dictate the natural order of life within it. Here’s a brief breakdown:<br /><br />

Amber Faction<br />
Era: Eldritch.<br />
Magik: A decent flow.<br />
Tech: Natives are mostly limited to iron tools.<br />
This faction is well known for its history, as it houses some of the first planets ever to form in the universe. This also makes it a hub for researchers, poachers, archeologists, cultists, sages, and vacationers. It is the largest faction, but also houses the greatest number of barren or uninhabitable planets.<br />
The leaders of this faction are royal siblings. They rule quite casually as they often opt to ignore any happenings that fail to capture their attention. This is reflected by the rather open ended set of laws that bind their realm. Their "forgiving" nature led the Amber Faction to become a safe haven for criminals and black market vendors. There is much to uncover in this realm, but it serves as a dangerous place to reside.<br /><br />

Rhinestone Faction<br />
Era: Sci-Fantasy.<br />
Magik: Incredibly strong stream.<br />
Tech: Limited to mana fueled machines and contraptions.<br />
This faction is regarded as the mystic faction, as it has become a home to many magikally gifted individuals. It resides at the supposed "Center of the Universe'' where all Magik begins. Here the ancient Cores of Existence sleep. From the dreams of these primordial beings does Magik flow. Rhinestone is also the smallest faction, but it houses the largest number of inhabitants out of any of the other 6 factions.<br />
The leader of the Rhinestone Faction is the Elder Sorceress Imacc Ko. Of all the leaders chosen by Chimera at the Limen Summit, Imacc was the only one who was not initially selected. She was given a faction because she simply couldn't be killed. Her life-force was far too strong to be snuffed out by simple weaponry. So Chimera altered their plans to make room for a seventh faction. Imacc rules with a kind heart and iron fists. She has strict laws that must be upheld within her faction, and although she despises what took place at the Limen Summit, she believes that the means justify the end.<br /><br />

Jade Faction<br />
Era: Clashing.<br />
Magik: Nominal presence.<br />
Tech: Old world with some more modern mixed in.<br />
This war torn faction is defined by its incredibly destructive inhabitants. Jade is highly populated by a multitude of separate clans all vying for the same precious mineral. Long ago the mineral was discovered within the core of the planet called Versa, and the various clans of this world exploded into war while trying to harvest and sell as much of it as they could for CHIMERA. Eventually the veins all ran dry, and the worldwide wars fizzled out. The now unfathomably rich Versa clans all fled from their planet, leaving it to crumble to dust. In the modern era, the Versa Clans continue their wars on other planets, seeking to harvest the precious minerals which had destroyed their own home decades ago. <br />
The leader of Jade is known as Stress. A self proclaimed god of death who absorbs the souls of those killed in combat, storing them in his Dire Blade. His laws permit open execution and violence to no avail, making his faction an incredibly dangerous system to traverse.<br /><br />

Obsidian Faction<br />
Era: Pseudo-Modern.<br />
Magik: Contained as an energy source.<br />
Tech: Bio modifications.<br />
Peridot serves as the largest trade faction in the entire universe, handling the production and distribution of bio-tech prosthetics, modifications, weaponry, and so much more. This faction is also the second largest in size, containing the largest number of humanoid planets to date. This includes Limen, the homeworld of CHIMERA. Peridot is also home to the most diverse population among other factions, clocking in at over 120 different and diverse humanoid species recognized and protected under the Eden Complex as sentient beings.<br />
The leader of the Peridot Faction is the horrifying Ulfric of Armantess. A notorious dictator famous for the many biotech modifications that ensure the longevity of his life. His laws are strict but fair, ensuring an equal opportunity to all who handle their business within Obsidian, keeping in mind Chimera was given special attention, naturally.<br /><br />

Zircon Faction<br />
Era: Dystopian.<br />
Magik: Limited to specialists.<br />
Tech: Raypunk.<br />
The Zircon Faction is the universe's largest producer of Cereb Jump devices. It is also known for its artificial inhabitants which make up over 79% of the faction. Zircon is also the third largest faction with over 30 artificial planetoids to date.<br />
The leader of Zircon is an A.I. capable of using the Cereb Jump to move entire planets. In fact Rossum was developed by the same scientist who created the Cereb Jump. After developing the brain hopping gizmo, the inventor went on to concoct a serum that virtually halted the aging process as well as a device known as the Imprint Scope. Using it, the scientist was able to develop a copy of Rossum’s mind and place it within a devastatingly powerful robotic body. In this faction there are certain planets in which biological life is prohibited from traveling, otherwise there are none too many rules that bind the Obsidian faction.<br /><br />

Pearl Faction<br />
Era: Forgotten.<br />
Magic: Barely trickling.<br />
Tech: Salvaged Junk.<br />
Pearl is known as the garbage dump of the galaxy, housing fewer than 1,000,000 inhabitants. During its founding, the leader of pearl denied travelers from moving into the faction, only allowing them to stop briefly to collect parts or visit. The reason being that Pearl serves as a universal dump, so any space that could house travelers is instead used to house refuse. This faction also has small territories located within the other factions, acting as dumpsters so-to-speak.<br />
The leader of the Pearl faction is a massive hulking warrior known as Karnuk. After being recognized for his strength, Karnuk was given his own faction which he then used for waste disposal. The warrior leader is a powerful fighter as well as an exceptional craftsman. So he used any trash he could salvage to develop strange weapons, robots, and even biological life. Karnuk also legalized murder in his faction, but made it illegal to loot bodies. Anything that landed in his faction, without a heartbeat, belonged to him, including corpses.<br /><br />

Azure Faction<br />
Era: Medieval.<br />
Magik: Prosperous.<br />
Tech: Gunpowder.<br />
The final faction is known for its peaceful landscapes and relaxed inhabitants. Azure is a land that deals heavily in its own matters. Trade is minimal, and technology is mostly prohibited. For this reason, it is known as the exiled lands. Here, you are stripped of your weapons, mods, and any other technology you might own. Azure is for the relaxed who seek to live a simple life, uninvolved in the bustling universe around them.<br />
The leader of the Azure Faction, Archimedes Alms, is known as a peacemaker. One who's current project involves ending the feud in the Jade faction. His rulings are strict but simple. "Come to Azure with only yourself, then yourself shall become Azure."<br />
Simply put, to start your life anew you must leave everything behind.<br />
