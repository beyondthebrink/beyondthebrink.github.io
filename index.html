									<h2><a href=>◎What is the Brink?◎</a></h2>
									<p>Simply put, the Brink is the name for the setting of this story. It is a collection of 7 Factions that each inhabit a system of the known universe. Beyond the Brink is uncharted space, disconnected from the web which controls the flow of all goods and information. Naturally, the web is under the control of CHIMERA, the universe's biggest super-conglomerate.

									<h2><a href=>◎What is CHIMERA?◎</a></h2>
									<p>CHIMERA is an interplanetary super conglomerate obsessed with the acquisition and commercialization of mostly uninhabited planets. After the invention of the Cereb Jump modification, and the establishment of the Universal Code, the Chimera Corp grew exponentially, becoming the largest company in the entire universe. It employs trillions of individuals every cycle to conquer, terra-form, claim, or establish treaties on foreign and unmarked planets throughout various different galaxies within the Brink. In short, they buy and sell worlds with little concern as to what their inhabitants think. Not to mention they act as liaisons for universal commerce. Sticking their thumbs deep into the many different businesses that funnel credits across each and every planet within the Brink. Technology, medical supplies, political establishment, arms dealing, magik flux, you name it. If there’s money to be made, CHIMERA is taking a cut of it. Naturally a business of this scale couldn't have just a single figurehead. So once the Cereb Jump opened bridges all across the galaxy, it wasn't long before the original council that oversaw CHIMERA was up for re-election. However, there was a sudden and unfortunate "departure" of over 220 candidates that had been brought in to apply for the council positions. In the end there was only one applicant left to fill all three 3 seats. So, naturally, he cloned himself. Since then CHIMERA has been overseen by the council of Mr. Mables.
