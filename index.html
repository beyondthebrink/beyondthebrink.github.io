									<h2><a href=>A creative mind.</a></h2>
									<p>Here is a little bit about me. I am a recent graduate of Becker College now with a bachelors in Interactive Media and Design along with a minor in Psychology. 
										During my time at Becker I was given the opportunity to work on a multitude of game related projects. To start, was the writing lead on the Millhavior Project at the Rudder Haven studio in Worcester.
										The project started out as an MMORPG which required hundreds of Questlines and dialogue branches. 
										I also worked as the design lead for a game project with Fidelity Investments. During which I learned a lot along the lines of Concepting and Game Development.
										Lastly I was given the chance to fill the role of Design and Narrative lead on the Journey to Blackwood project at Becker college. 
										There I was tasked with creating a holistic storyline that focused on teaching 3rd-5th grade students important life skills in order to combat the opioid crisis currently facing Boston Massachusetts.
										All three projects required vastly different skillsets, and it is because of these experiences that I have a deeper understanding of Game Art, Audio, Programming, Producing, and Design.
										While at college I discovered my strengths in storyboarding, 3D modeling, environmental texturing, and game narrative design.
										In my free time I enjoy writing short stories, drawing character concepts, producing music, editing videos, and spending WAY too much time on organizing my various Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns.
